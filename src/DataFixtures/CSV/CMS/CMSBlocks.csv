<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2><strong>Q:&nbsp; When my 4-Month FREE Trial period ends will we have to pay?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> No, so long as you:</h3>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Maintain at least 80% of your budgeted jobs on CityGovJobs so that job seekers can submit interest in them; and</h3>

<h3>2.&nbsp; Post Job Alerts or Job Annoncements on CityGovJobs when doing recruitments for the same jobs that are visible to job seekers on CityGovJobs.*</h3>

<address>*It would be unfair to job seekers who submit interest in your jobs to not post job alerts or announcements to them.&nbsp; It literally only takes seconds to post a Job Alert.</address>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Q:&nbsp; How is the 80% threshold determined?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>A:&nbsp; </strong>From your &quot;Manage Job Titles&quot; page, you can &quot;Hide&quot; job titles from job seekers that are using CityGovJobs.&nbsp; Each job title you hide causes your percentage of job titles available to job seekers to drop.&nbsp; When you hide 20% of your job titles, you will be prompted to start a paid subscription. Also, failure to post jobs that are visible to job seekers on CityGovJobs could result in more and more of your jobs being hidden by CityGovJobs&#39; administrators and cause you to start a paid subscription in order to post jobs.&nbsp; You may add newly budgeted jobs to increase your counts if desired, but the job titles should be budgeted positions.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Q:&nbsp; How do I <u>Hide</u> job titles from Job Seekers?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> Below steps may be used to hide budgted job titles:</h3>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Jobs&quot; at top of your Dashboard.</h3>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Click on the 3 vertical dots on the right side of the table for the job title you want to hide, and select Hide.</h3>

<h3>5.&nbsp; When you hide a job title the percentage of jobs available to job seekers will display in a pop up.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Q:&nbsp; How do I <u>Delete</u> job titles that are no longer budgeted?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> Below steps may be used to delete job titles:</h3>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Click on the 3 vertical dots on the right side of the table for the job title you want to delete, and select Delete.</h3>

<address>NOTE:&nbsp; All submitted interest will be deleted, so be sure it&#39;s the right job title.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, according to our Terms of Use Agreement, you may only delete non-budgeted job titles.</address>

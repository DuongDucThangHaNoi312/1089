                                    <span>"I can totally relate to Citygovjobs' vision. Now that my children are grown,
                                        I decided to re-invent myself and find a new career. After months of searching for
                                        jobs using other websites, I realized that my applications and resumes
                                        were not producing desired results. It was disheartening. There were just too many
                                        various jobs for me to filter through and the websites I used were very time-consuming.
                                        I now hope to help change that for others here at Citygovjobs.‚Äù
